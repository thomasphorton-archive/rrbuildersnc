		<p><span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span>When my wife and I were looking for a new home, we were immediately drawn to R & R Builder's distinctive style and outstanding quality. Rick Riddle happened to be on site at the time and after our first meeting with him, we knew we had found our builder. Until that point, looking for a new home had been a tedious, disappointing process. Many builders, especially larger companies, seem too busy to ensure their homes are built to last. We had never built a custom home before and had several questions and concerns. Rick was patient and helpful, with a knowledge that can only be attained through years of experience. R & R Builders made the process of building a custom home exciting and enjoyable, and  I look forward to working with them again on my future building and remodeling projects.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></p>

		<p><span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span>I am happy to recommend R & R Builders to anyone looking for a new home. The father-son team of Rick and Logan Riddle ensured every detail of our home was built to perfection. I have had such great memories with my family here. After we moved in, we decided on living room addition and didn't hesitate to contact R & R. Their guys are respectful and did the work in a clean, timely manner, and the results were amazing! For experienced builders that don't accept anything less than the best, look no further than R & R Builders.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></p>
